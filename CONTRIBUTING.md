# Contributing

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸ˜„

Feel free to submit a pull request to add cafÃ©s you've been to. Please, obtain the internet speed (download speed and speedtest link) and the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the cafÃ© and then add them to the corresponding [geoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) file. If your city doesn't exist in the repo, create a new geoJSON file. For the format, see [athens.geojson](athens.geojson).

- **Internet Speed:** Please use [Speedtest](https://www.speedtest.net) to test the speed and performance of the internet connection.
- **Schema:**
    - **Properties:**  The "Name", "Download Speed" and "Speedtest Link" members are *required*. In addition to these, you can add any members you want (such as "Comment", "Menu", etc.).
    - **Geometry:** The "coordinates" and "type" members are *required*. The "coordinates" member should be an array of the coordinates (longitude and latitude). The value of the "type" member must be "Point".

    Example of a GeoJSON feature schema:
    ```json
    {
        "type": "Feature",
        "properties": {
            "Name": "<NAME_OF_THE_CAFE>",
            "Download Speed": "<DOWNLOAD_SPEED> Mbps",
            "Speedtest Link": "<SPEEDTEST_RESULT_LINK>"
        },
        "geometry": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                12.3456789,
                98.7654321
            ]
        }
    }
    ```
